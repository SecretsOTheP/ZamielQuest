ZamielQuest
===========

This was my attempt to get MacroQuest-like functionality on the Mac version of EverQuest by creating a wrapper around GDB.

EQMac was shut down in 2013, so this program is now largely useless. However, the act of programming was extremely useful in understanding how reverse engineering X64 works, so it may be useful for others.
